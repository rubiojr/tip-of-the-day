# Encrypted Bash history backups

**Pre-requisites:**

* https://github.com/jcsalterego/historian configured
* GPG configured for asymmetric encryption
* Minio client (https://github.com/minio/mc) and hosted Minio server (or S3)

**Recipe:**

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```
backup_history() {
  # Encrypt the sqlite database
  gpg --batch --yes -r <recipient-here> -e ~/.historian.db
  # Upload it to your S3 remote (home in my case)
  mc -q cp ~/.historian.db.gpg home/rubiojr/historian.db.gpg-$(date +%Y%m%d) >/dev/null
}

backup_history & >/dev/null
```

That'll encrypt historian's sqlite database (one backup per day) and upload it to the S3 remote every time you open a new shell.

**Alternatives:**

Use a cronjob (Linux) or launchd (macOS).
